# C - File I/O
System calls are the calls that a program makes to the system kernel to provide the services to which the program does not have direct access. For example, providing access to input and output devices such as monitors and keyboards. We can use various functions provided in the C Programming language for input/output system calls such as create, open, read, write, etc.
